# Images

This directory contains all custom images built for the daemons deployed in this repository, and over time we aim to build all daemons from source. Additions should be reproducible and leverage pinned source hashes wherever possible. The images in the initial commit to this directory were migrated from their respective repositories using the approach defined [here](https://x3ro.de/integrating-a-submodule-into-the-parent-repository/) to preserve the commit history.
